Constraints from user (deadlines, team size, fixed dates): **$ARGUMENTS**

Phase 9 of the pipeline. Inputs: `.delivery/initiatives/<initiative>/prd.md`, `.delivery/initiatives/<initiative>/architecture.md`, `.delivery/initiatives/<initiative>/prioritization.md`. Output: `.delivery/initiatives/<initiative>/roadmap.md`.

## Where `.delivery/` resolves to

Not necessarily the repository root. Resolve before reading or writing anything below:

1. **Reuse.** An existing `.delivery/` anywhere reachable from the working directory wins — never create a second one.
2. **Explicit override.** Otherwise honor a delivery-root path stated in the nearest `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md`.
3. **Ask, don't guess.** Otherwise, if this repository holds more than one independently-releasable component (multiple `package.json`/`plugin.json`/`pyproject.toml`, workspace members, or similar) stop and ask which component this work belongs to. Silently defaulting to the repo root in a multi-component repo is the failure this step exists to prevent.
4. **Default.** Otherwise, use `.delivery/` at the repository root.

## Which initiative

Every artifact below lives under `.delivery/initiatives/<slug>/`, never directly under
`.delivery/` — this is what lets independent initiatives (epics, sprints, parallel
workstreams) be planned in parallel branches without colliding on the same shared file
(`ADR-004`; the incident that motivated it: two initiatives independently continued the same
`S-n`/`FR-n` sequence in one shared `prd.md`, discovered only at merge). Resolve which
initiative before reading or writing anything below:

1. **Explicit signal.** The user names an initiative, or one is already established for this
   conversation — use it.
2. **Exactly one exists.** If `.delivery/initiatives/` has exactly one subdirectory, use it
   without asking — this keeps single-initiative projects exactly as simple as before this
   convention existed.
3. **Ask, don't guess.** Otherwise (zero, or more than one, with no explicit signal) — ask
   which initiative this work belongs to, or whether to start a new one. Never silently
   default to the most recently modified one.
4. **Starting a new initiative.** Confirm its slug (kebab-case, derived from the brief
   subject or what the user names) before creating `.delivery/initiatives/<slug>/` — check it
   doesn't collide with an existing initiative slug or any other top-level `.delivery/` entry.
   A genuinely new initiative needs its own `/delivery:brief`, or an explicit
   `extends: <existing-slug>` note (in this new initiative's own first artifact) declaring it
   reuses an existing initiative's problem framing instead of running its own — state which,
   don't leave it implicit.

Cross-cutting, project-wide, never per-initiative: `.delivery/glossary.md`,
`.delivery/personas/`, `.delivery/interviews/`, `.delivery/simulations/`,
`.delivery/decisions/ADR-NNN-*.md`, `.delivery/invocations/<session_id>.ndjson`.
`.delivery/stories/`, `.delivery/reviews/`, `.delivery/sprints/` stay flat but are prefixed
by initiative slug, matching `stories/<slug>-NN-<name>.md`'s existing convention.

## Gate check

Read both inputs.

- **PRD missing** — stop. Sequencing unknown requirements is fiction. Run `/delivery:prd` first.
- **Architecture missing** — warn clearly. You can sequence without it, but the dependency map and effort sizing will be guesses, and the spike list — the most valuable input to sequencing — will not exist. Ask whether to proceed anyway or run `/delivery:architecture` first.

If `.delivery/initiatives/<initiative>/roadmap.md` already exists, read it and ask whether
to **revise**, **replace**, or **start new version**. See
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/version-history.md` for what each means, the same-problem
test that chooses between revise and start new version, and the Version-history table and
Corrections log it writes. Never silently overwrite.

Ask the user for any constraints not given in `$ARGUMENTS`: team size and composition, fixed external dates, and whether scope or date is the fixed variable. A roadmap built without knowing which one is fixed will optimize for the wrong thing.


**Open blocking findings.** Read `.delivery/reviews/`. If any finding against an artifact
this phase consumes has status `open` and severity `blocking`, **stop and report them** — do
not proceed. A blocking finding is one a reviewer said must be resolved before this point;
building on it means every downstream artifact inherits a known, documented defect with no
resolution on record.

Resolving means the finding is marked `fixed`, or `rejected` with the reason recorded. The
user may still choose to proceed over an open finding — that is their call, not a default.
Ask, and record what they chose.

## Run

**1. Program Manager builds the plan.** Delegate to `delivery:program-manager` (via the Agent tool; if subagents are unavailable, read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/agents/program-manager.md` and adopt the persona). It must deliver:
- **Phases** with entry and exit criteria, each producing something demonstrable — describe what you would show. Setup never becomes its own phase: fold `architecture.md`'s Setup section into Phase 1's entry criteria — a phase needs a persona-facing demonstrable exit and an `FR-n` it delivers, and setup work has neither.
- **Risk-first sequencing**: the spikes from the architecture and the least-understood work go early. State the sequencing rationale; a plan that front-loads the easy work should have to justify itself.
- **Dependency map**, including dependencies outside the team's control, each with an owner and needed-by date
- **Critical path** identified explicitly, with what would have to change to shorten it
- **Sizing** in relative terms with a confidence label per item. Never a single-point date for unscoped work.
- **Risks** with mitigations and owners
- **Cut list per phase** — what gets dropped first if the phase runs late, decided now rather than under pressure

**2. Reconcile value against real cost — the second prioritisation pass.** `prioritization.md` ranked requirements on value with pre-architecture effort guesses. Now the architecture has revealed what things actually cost, so re-check the staging against real numbers.

Look specifically for **inversions**: a requirement sitting in the MVP whose cost turned out far higher than assumed, or a deferred requirement that turns out nearly free once the MVP work exists. Both are common and neither is visible before architecture. For each inversion, state the value, the revised cost, and a recommendation.

Do not silently re-stage. Prioritisation is the Product Owner's call — present the inversions and let them decide, then record what they chose.

**3. QA Strategist places the verification.** Delegate to `delivery:qa-strategist` to map risk-based coverage onto the phases, so testing is continuous rather than a final phase.

**4. Critic checks the plan holds.** Delegate to `delivery:feature-critic` (read-only) specifically to check: do parallel tracks secretly share a person or an unbuilt component? Does the sequence match the architecture's dependencies? Is integration deferred to the end? Fold blocking findings in.

**5. Write the roadmap** to `.delivery/initiatives/<initiative>/roadmap.md` using `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/templates/roadmap.md`. Trace each phase back to the `FR-n` IDs it delivers, so coverage gaps are visible.

## Exit criteria

- Within the template's budget, or the overrun declared in the document with its reason — count the words, do not estimate

- Every phase has a demonstrable exit criterion, not an internal artifact
- The critical path is named
- Dependencies outside the team's control have owners and dates
- Sizes carry confidence labels
- Each phase has a cut list
- Every `FR-n` in the PRD maps to a phase, or is explicitly deferred

## Language

Read `.delivery/glossary.md` first and use its terms exactly. If it does not exist, run
`/delivery:glossary` — or, for a small effort, collect terms as you go and propose the file
at the end. Do not coin synonyms for concepts it already names.

Any term you need that is missing gets **proposed explicitly**, with a definition in the
business's vocabulary and a concrete referent. Any term carrying two meanings gets raised as
a defect, not resolved silently.

**Questions go out in the vocabulary of whoever must answer them**, with a worked example in
their world. A question for the business owner written in engineering terms is a blocker
with a name on it, not a question. If a question is really an engineering call, decide it
here rather than routing it to them.

## Writing, then revising

**Budget: 700 words target, 1100 hard cap** (excludes code, YAML and data tables).

**Compose first. Do not try to hit the budget while writing.** Restraint during
composition trades substance for brevity in the wrong order — the findings get thinner
while the scaffolding survives. Write what the artifact needs, then cut what it does not.

**Then measure, do not estimate.** The budget counts **prose only**. Data tables, code
blocks and YAML are excluded, so measure with them stripped:

```bash
grep -v '^|' <the file you just wrote> | wc -w
```

A plain `wc -w` counts the tables and will overstate the total, often by several times.
Measuring the wrong number leads to cutting the wrong thing.

**Rows in a data table can never help you meet the budget, because they are not counted.**
Deleting them is pure loss for zero benefit. The term table, the requirement table, the
findings table, the friction map — these *are* the artifact. If a revision pass is removing
rows, it has misunderstood the rule and should stop.

**If the count exceeds 1100, you are not finished.** Make a revision pass over the file and
delete, in this order, until it fits:

1. Preamble, recap, and any sentence describing what the document is about to say
2. **Restatement** — the same fact as prose *and* a table row *and* a summary bullet. Keep the form that carries it best; delete the others. This is almost always the biggest win.
3. Process narration — "I examined X and found Y" becomes Y
4. Hedging — either you know it, or it is labelled an assumption. Both are shorter.
5. Citations past the first for a given claim
6. Examples past the first, unless the next one shows a *different* failure mode

Then re-measure with the same command and confirm.

**Never delete** any row of a data table, findings and their failure scenarios, one citation per claim, grounding
and confidence labels, synthetic-output warnings, open questions, or IDs a later phase
reads. If the artifact cannot fit without losing those, keep them, exceed the cap, and
**write the final count and the reason into the document**. A declared overrun is a
judgement. A silent one is a habit.


## Hand off

Report exit criteria status. Call out any `FR-n` that landed in no phase — that is a silent scope drop and the Product Owner needs to see it. If the plan cannot fit the scope, present the tradeoff with options rather than trimming requirements to make a date work. Next step: `/delivery:stories`.
